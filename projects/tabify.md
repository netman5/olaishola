## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project came from the lack of organization structure in chrome bookmarks. When a web page is bookmarked, chrome automatically stored it at the bottom of the list. Looking for the just bookmarked page one has to scroll to the bottom of the list to be able to restored the web page. Another one is that, there is no way of bookmarking web pages based on there purpose of opening. For example, let say I'm working on learning nodejs and I have like four tabs opened, there's no means of saving those tabs in a group or category for quick referencing.

## What it does
A one-stop bookmark management tool for the users. It is a chrome extension that capture all your tabs in the current window under a defined category and group to restore tabs as at when required.

### Functionalities:

- options to either delete or restore tabs base on preference.
- option to delete entire tab group

## How we built it

Tabify was built using technologies such as chrome, Redux, ReactJS as UI framework in the chrome extension, Material UI and also integrated email services using Twilio Send Grid API.


## Challenge we ran into

No one in our team was familiar with chrome extension development, we learned the basics and started implementing them side-by-side in our project. We got stuck at many places but due to team spirit, we resolved all the issues. Also, managing states in the process of development was a challenge we faced. Conflicting time-zones was also difficult, but we tried to solve it with ease
